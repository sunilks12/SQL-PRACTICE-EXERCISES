Given two tables below, write a query to display the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of 
the average salary of employees in a department to the companyâ€™s average salary.

WITH t1 AS
(
	SELECT TO_CHAR(pay_date,'YYYY-MM') as pay_month, department_id, 
	AVG(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY DATE_PART('month',pay_date),department_id) as dept_avg, 
	AVG(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY DATE_PART('month',pay_date)) as comp_avg
	FROM salary as s JOIN employee as e
	USING (employee_id)
)

SELECT DISTINCT pay_month, department_id, 
       CASE WHEN dept_avg > comp_avg THEN 'higher'
       WHEN dept_avg = comp_avg THEN 'same'
ELSE 'lower'
END AS comparison
FROM t1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
